% If you have already submitted an article to an ACM/SIGS Conference, and have had your
% article published in one of the 'Proceedings', then you have probably used
% the (ACM/SIGS) 'sig-alternate' class and .tex file.
% Any such 'conference-prepared' source .tex file is 'compatible' with the class file
% 'research4cacm' which you will use to prepare your article for inclusion in the magazine 'CACM'.
%
% Here are the steps to take in order to 'morph' your article from being
% a 'conference' article to one more suitable for inclusion in 'Communications of the ACM'.
%
% 1. Change \documentclass{sig-alternate}  to \documentclass{research4cacm}
%
% 2. Comment out the conference information e.g.  %\conferenceinfo{WOODSTOCK}{'97 El Paso, Texas USA}
%
% 3. Make sure the copyright data is correct e.g. \crdata{0001-0782/08/0200}
%
% 4. Make sure the YEAR is correct e.g. \CopyrightYear{2008} with the current default being �2008�.
%
% 5. Comment out the Classification scheme, general terms and keywords.
%
% 6. If you have mentioned authors in the 'Additional Authors' section you should
%    'move them back' into the byline (so that they appear with all the other authors).
%    ALL authors, in Research Highlights articles, get equal billing.
%
% 7. Suitably edit the file (i.e. body text) so as to make it more appropriate for a wider audience.
%
% If, early on in the editorial process, the 'correct' copyright data becomes available
% please change the copyright data to suit, otherwise leave the default '0001-0782/08/0X00'.

\begin{abstract}
Reproducibility is a key tenet of all modern sciences.  Unfortunately
the current state of reproducibility in computational sciences is
lamentable.  We propose that journals in computational sciences should
encourage papers reproducing (or failing to reproduce) earlier work in
their field, by establishing clear criteria for assessing
reproducibility papers.

\section{Intro}


Samin and I, together with Tom Crick (Cardiff) have written
some conference papers around the ideas of reproducibility in science
and specifically in scientific software development. Following our
first paper, we have been asked to write a contributed article for
CACM and we were planning on using it as an opportunity to present a
prototype software platform for compiling and testing software on the
cloud, whilst it�s being edited by different parties. The general
idea is that initially a user checks their latest code into visual
studio online or github. This triggers an event on a cloud server,
causing the new version to be pulled to the server, external
dependencies downloaded, the code to be compiled, and several tests
run on the new binaries. One plan for the prototype is to have the BMA
compile and be tested using this mechanism, as a proof of concept.


Pull together WSSSPE2 and Recomp2014. 


After the last submission, I have been thinking about the relationship
between the two papers. I was glad to have written the second one as I
felt it was really the second half of the first; one said that
implementation was hard, whereas the second was focused on how models
themselves might limit reproducibity efforts. I would like this
manuscript to bridge both of these topics, and particularly I'd like
to address the CI system aspects. So, roughly I'd hope that the paper
would read in 3 sections

 

1) Implementation problems. Expand to include broader topics in the
literature (e.g. the machine learning reference I sent around)

 

2) Models/benchmarks. To be frank, I'd like to be more direct
addressing performance based benchmarks here than we were in the
previous paper. Whilst I realize this is hard on the cloud, the more I
have thought about it I don't think counting operations (as suggested)
makes much sense- plus Samin and I have an example from a recent paper
(Samin- our CAV paper) where counting operations on a small benchmark
set wrongly indicated efficiency.

 

3) The system itself. I don't know what your thoughts are, but I
wonder if it would be possible to set up a simple piece of software,
with a couple of dependencies, just to show what it looked like. We
just decide on an analysis (I can suggest some simple ones), write a
small piece of code which does it (with a couple of dependencies), and
make the code test itself during the build process. One specific
example of a tool that might be appropriate could be a protein
structure analysis called the Gaussian Network Model. Its easy to
implement (and I've done it a few times), and could be linked to the
PDB for a set of tests/benchmarks.





\section{Tom Intro}

\subsection{Bullet Points}
Not sure about the name "reproducibility papers" because "reproducible
papers" is a name for, e.g., Sweave'd papers.

We should look through journal instructions to authors for mention of
reproducibility both on output (ie. new papers should ahve some nod
towards reproducibility) and more importantly on input (are
reproducibility studies explicitly encouraged.)  Probably best to
archive them and put the details online, and put data in the
paper. Should be sensible and reasonable sized sample (e.g. all ACM
journals, journals in some other sensible ranking).

(cite to check bib~\cite{crick-et-al_wssspe2})

\begin{itemize}


\item initiatives in other disciplines (Cardiff person?) pre-registration?
\item Positive results may be unpublishable!   

\item Reproducibility

\item Culture Change 
\item Incentives.  

\item Feeling a fraud as open stuff... true across the field.  E.g. we trust resutls from others and reproduce things.

\item cf dissemination model is broken... impending crisis

\item E.g. give examples of ourselves.   ICLP 09?  Ian can find lots, honest!

\item Examples of tracks applications ... 

\item part of core phd skills training
\item instead of giving a student 100 papers to read and write a literature review, give them one and write a reproducibility studies
\item thinking of Ian Miguel and Lars Kotthoff, got journal papers out of lit reviews
\item Ian's first paper about counterfactuals





\item Example of good journals
\begin{itemize}
\item Springer?
\item IPOL
\item
Journal 2010-2012
Never published a paper!
Folded into Code

\item reproducibility project in psychology?

\item thing where people reproduced old papers.  (repo 

\end{itemize}



\end{itemize}

\subsection{ Review standards }

Make a particular proposal. 

Reproducibility is broad ... 


Quality of work and paper is AIJ quality
Novelty not assessed in normal way
Originality is in study of reproducibility of some major piece of AI
Could expose flaws in conventional wisdom if original experiments not reproducible
Could show that conventional wisdom is completely correct 
Either way community has solid basis for understanding 
Often expect new critical insights e.g. on importance of neglected implementation issues
Paper itself should have very high standard of reproducibility
Compare survey paper:
Novelty not assessed in normal way
Likely to improve understanding through selection, presentation, and new insights
