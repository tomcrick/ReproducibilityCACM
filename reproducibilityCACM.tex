% Sample file for 'CACM - Research Highlights'-type articles
% Created by: Gerry Murray, Elec. Pub. Info. Mgr., Pubs. Dept., ACM HQ, NY.
% (murray@hq.acm.org)
%
% This is "research-highlights-sample.tex" (sample file) V1.1 Sept. 2008
% This file should be compiled with V1.1 of "research4cacm.cls" Sept. 2008
%
% If you have already submitted an article to an ACM/SIGS Conference, and have had your
% article published in one of the 'Proceedings', then you have probably used
% the (ACM/SIGS) 'sig-alternate' class and .tex file.
% Any such 'conference-prepared' source .tex file is 'compatible' with the class file
% 'research4cacm' which you will use to prepare your article for inclusion in the magazine 'CACM'.
%
% Here are the steps to take in order to 'morph' your article from being
% a 'conference' article to one more suitable for inclusion in 'Communications of the ACM'.
%
% 1. Change \documentclass{sig-alternate}  to \documentclass{research4cacm}
%
% 2. Comment out the conference information e.g.  %\conferenceinfo{WOODSTOCK}{'97 El Paso, Texas USA}
%
% 3. Make sure the copyright data is correct e.g. \crdata{0001-0782/08/0200}
%
% 4. Make sure the YEAR is correct e.g. \CopyrightYear{2008} with the current default being ‘2008’.
%
% 5. Comment out the Classification scheme, general terms and keywords.
%
% 6. If you have mentioned authors in the 'Additional Authors' section you should
%    'move them back' into the byline (so that they appear with all the other authors).
%    ALL authors, in Research Highlights articles, get equal billing.
%
% 7. Suitably edit the file (i.e. body text) so as to make it more appropriate for a wider audience.
%
% If, early on in the editorial process, the 'correct' copyright data becomes available
% please change the copyright data to suit, otherwise leave the default '0001-0782/08/0X00'.
% (The editorial staff will change it later on in the production cycle.)

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Reproducibility is a key tenet of all modern sciences.  Unfortunately
the current state of reproducibility in computational sciences is
lamentable.  We propose that journals in computational sciences should
encourage papers reproducing (or failing to reproduce) earlier work in
their field, by establishing clear criteria for assessing
reproducibility papers.
\end{abstract}

% The classification Scheme, General Terms and Keywords are not appropriate for CACM so comment them out.

\section*{Notes}

Not sure about the name "reproducibility papers" because "reproducible
papers" is a name for, e.g., Sweave'd papers.

We should look through journal instructions to authors for mention of
reproducibility both on output (ie. new papers should ahve some nod
towards reproducibility) and more importantly on input (are
reproducibility studies explicitly encouraged.)  Probably best to
archive them and put the details online, and put data in the
paper. Should be sensible and reasonable sized sample (e.g. all ACM
journals, journals in some other sensible ranking).
